# Object-Oriented-Programming
## Polymorpism
Ability to reuse the same code within two diferent but related objects and for that code behavior to automatically adjust appropriately.
## Encapsulation
Hiding implement for external user. Team use code from another team but dont need to know what be implemented inside.

## Abstract Class
- Serves the purpose to create code that will be shared by the subclasses.
- Should never actually be instantiated with the keyword "new"

### Abstract Method: 
- Method without implementation, only method header.

## Interfaces
- A list of method definition that guarantees behavior of an object. Similar to a certificate or contract.
- Set a standard of behavior how your objects is gonna relate to external object.
- Java already has some popular interfaces: Comparable, Iterable, List
